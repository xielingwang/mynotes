# Motivation
Here's the PHP function library which included functions or classes I written or used in my passed projects. Just for memory. And god knows they will just help you at some time.

Push the issue to let me know at any time if you have got some suggestions, error discoveries or discussions.

# Structure

This repository includes 2 branches: master and ohmygod.

Yeah, I will push new codes into `ohmygod` at any time. 

But I will tidy it and merge to `master`, maybe once a week or once a month.
